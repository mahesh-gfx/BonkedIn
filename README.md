# Bonkedin: A satirical alternative to LinkedIn

# Why BonkedIn?
LinkedIn, once a bastion of professional networking, has become a circus of clowns vying for attention through dubious means. The platform is now drowning in a sea of fake engagement, sloppy AI-generated content, and influencers who seem to have lost sight of LinkedIn's professional purpose

In a world saturated with overly serious, self-aggrandizing professional networks, BonkedIn offers a refreshing and humorous(very profssional, very nice!) alternative.
